### Docker image on Alpine Linux

This Docker image [(0xnu20/alpine)](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xnu20/alpine/) uses [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) as its base image. For more information on versions and support see [Releases](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:Releases).

#### Why Alpine?
Alpine is 3x faster than Ubuntu with a 4.62 real life seconds wait time compared to Ubuntuâ€™s 14.66 seconds. It is time too valuable to be wasted just for a programming test. Read more [here](https://finbarrs.eu/dev/2018/03/17/docker-react/).
